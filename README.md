# vanguard-dvar-hasher
Vanguard Dvar Hasher. Used to hash commands to be able to used within a command buffer tool.


To use:

# DVAR Hasher

This executable will hash your DVAR's for you! No need to search for them :)

Simply enter the DVAR you'd like to hash, and it'll spit out a string such as "0x8BD4585C77E2050" (cg_fovScale).

NOTE:

- Replace the "0x" at the start with "#x3", so "0x8BD4585C77E2050" would become "#x38BD4585C77E2050".

- Remember to ***not*** add the value to the string when hashing!! **Only after.**

(Vanguard only)
